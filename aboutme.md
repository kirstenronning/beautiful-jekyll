### Where I've Been

I was born and raised in Chandler, Arizona, and it was not a hard decision to attend Arizona State University. I began classes immediately after high school, pursuing concurrent degrees in Business Data Analytics (BS) and Dance (BFA). After four years of school, I was able to graduate Summa Cum Laude from Barrett, the Honors College with a Bachelor of Science in Business Data Analytics, a Bachelor of Science in Sociology, a Minor in Dance, and a Certificate in International Studies. My culminating capstone was my Honors Thesis: Attitudes and Experiences with Period Poverty at Arizona State University, where I created a survey and used analyziation tools to provide a report to Arizona State University about the effects of period poverty on our students. Clearly one for multi-tasking, I have a passion for diversifying my skills and showing up in multiple capacities.

One of my proudest achievements from Undergrad is receiving my 200-hour RYT Yoga Teacher certification. Through CorePower Yoga, I was able to guide students in order to create a welcoming space where students felt motivated to flourish in their community. I worked my way up to Studio Assistant Manager of our Old Town Scottsdale location, and I was granted the opportunity to lead two separate Yoga Teacher Trainings.
