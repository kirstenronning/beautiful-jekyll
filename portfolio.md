### Capstone Project

[**Honors Thesis: Attitudes and Experiences with Period Poverty at Arizona State University**](Ronning_K_Spring_2020.pdf)

In recent years, feminist activists have taken their fascination and concern over access to period products in developing countries and diverted their attention to period poverty that exists in the United States. Backed by globalist approaches and the deep history of Menstrual Activism in the US, the Menstrual Equity Movement aims to make policy changes at the state and federal levels to ensure that all menstruators have the products they need to manage menstruation. This exploratory study aims to understand the experiences and attitudes about period poverty at Arizona State University’s campus. Undergraduate menstruators were asked to reflect on general and on campus experiences with access to period products. Quantitative and qualitative analyses were utilized in conducting this research. This study concludes that menstruators’ education would benefit from having access to free period products in all bathrooms. 

Keywords: menstrual equity, period poverty, menstrual activism, period products
